# SpaceInvadersASM

For my gradwork in DAE, I decided to research gameboy game development.
This project is part of my case study.

It is a Space Invaders 'clone' written in Game Boy Assembly with RGBDS.

# Dependencies
The .vscode file is configured with the Emulicious extension and Emulicious debugger.
It also expects you to have RGBDS installed (https://rgbds.gbdev.io/)
