# SpaceInvadersASM

For my gradwork in DAE, I decided to research Gameboy game development.
This project is part of my case study.

##Warning
Note that this is a project made to research the Assembly development method for Gameboy. This is code written by an absolute beginner and should not be taken as an example on how to do it.

It is a Space Invaders 'clone' written in Game Boy Assembly with RGBDS.

# Dependencies
The .vscode file is configured with the Emulicious extension and Emulicious debugger.
It also expects you to have RGBDS installed (https://rgbds.gbdev.io/)
